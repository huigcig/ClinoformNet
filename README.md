## ClinoformNet: stratigraphic forward modeling and deep learning for seismic clinoform delineation

ClinoformNet is an open source code created by the [Computational Interpretation Group (CIG)](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) for "ClinoformNet-1.0: stratigraphic forward modeling and deep learning for seismic clinoform delineation. Geoscientific Model Development (GMD), Vol. 16, 2495–2513.". [Hui Gao](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/hui/list.htm), [Xinming Wu](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/xinming/list.htm), [Jinyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nU-EQGsAAAAJ) and [Xiaoming Sun](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/xiaoming/list.htm) are the main contributors to the code.

This publicly available code contains the geological and geophysical forward modeling (Data_modeling files) and modified DeepLabV3+ code (Network files) for building synthetic clinoform seismic dataset and seismic clinoform delineation. The synthetic clinoform seismic dataset constructed from geological and geophysical forward modeling has been uploaded to Zenodo and are freely available at this [[link]](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7122471).
